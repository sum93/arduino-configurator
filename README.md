# arduino-configurator
This web application helps you configure your Arduino (Atmel ATmega328p) for some basic appliciations.

## Currently working applications:
* Timer:
  * Time Measure
  * Periodic Interrupt Generation
  * Square Wave Generator
  * Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
* ADC:
  * Signal Sampler with temperature measure

## Planned applications to be implemented:
* Analog-Digital Converter
  * Oversampling (canceled, since it not provides better resoultion just an avarage)

## TODOS:
* Testing
